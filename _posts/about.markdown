Postdoc Anne Bjorkman and the sTundra group have been working to compile a data base of tundra plant traits in collaboration with TRY data contributors and researchers working at sites around the tundra biome.  We have compiled ~70,000 observations of tundra plant traits from all over the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. In combination with the TRY database, this equals a total of more than 85,000 observations on 827 unique tundra species â€“ by far the largest database of tundra plant traits in the world.
