<h2>The Tundra Trait Team - Contact Information</h2>

The TTT database includes the name of the data contributor for every trait observation. If your analyses rely heavily on a data contributor's data, we recommend you get in touch with them (contact information below). We believe that collaborating with the original data contributors is beneficial to both data users and contributors, first because it recognizes the hard work that has gone into the collection of these data, and secondly because it can be helpful to data users to have input from someone who knows the sites and species so well.
